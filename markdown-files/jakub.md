I'm a 4th-year History Specialist who intends to go to law school this year. My focus on history has been the 20th century, but I've also been interested in 
contemporary history and the 19th century as well. Due to my Polish background, studying Eastern European history has been my main passion, but North American history and the 
rest of Europe are also interesting for me. I particularly enjoy learning about military history, but anything to do with high-level decision-making I enjoy the most.
