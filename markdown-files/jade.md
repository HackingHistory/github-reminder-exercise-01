Hi, I'm Jade and I am a 4th year History and Sexual Diversity Studies major. My interests are in queer fashion history. I like to look at queer history through the lens of clothing and the production of fashion aesthetics, prioritizing research on its ability to move through violent spaces, subverting heteronormative dominant cultures by creating a queer counterpublic, celebrating community, and resisting erasure. I am interested in how these intersections in queer fashion progress across transnational borders, informing their respective queer political status as both a mode of liberation and an extension of Western colonialism.
