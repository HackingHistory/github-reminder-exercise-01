I'm a 4th year student pursuing a History major, French minor, and Music History & Culture minor. My fields interests are Social and Cultural history in East Asia and Western Europe from 17th century onwards. I also like to study Western Arts music history and play the piano (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano).
