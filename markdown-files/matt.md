I'm a historian of science and technology studying mostly the **nineteenth** and _twentieth centuries_, who is also interested in environmental history & would like to start teaching world history in the future.  At U of T I'm mostly known for teaching digital humanities. I really love [kayaking](https://wikipedia.org/en/kayak).
