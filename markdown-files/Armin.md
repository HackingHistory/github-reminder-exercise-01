I am interested in modern Iran, social history, and historical methodology. My immediate interest is the role of higher education in Iranian nation building, but recently I have developed a growing interest in systems theory and the study of the emergence of integrative levels within the natural and human worlds, following the work of the recently deceased E.O. Wilson. I want to learn how to use software to analyze large and different amounts of non-archival data for the purpose of studying human society.
