# Research Interests

My research interests include the history of the middle ages, specifically power structures and class, and manuscript culture. I also study the history of the Cold War, the first Industrial Revolution, and the early Christianity. Recent writings have looked at medieval manuscript culture through Marshall McLuhan's *Laws of Media*. 

On the political side, I am interested in Canadian politics, international relations, and neo-realism.
